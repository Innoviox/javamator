## Roadmap
 - Write a python script to compare the output of an uploaded file to a JUNIT
   - Other methods? Stdout/stdin, downlnoad as eclipse/intellij project
 - Interface the script with an interface
   - Django would probably be easiest

NOTE: If you are prompted for a default owner for the JUnit model, say "awef".
