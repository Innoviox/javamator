Imagine a coordinate plane, like in math class.
This program will calculate the distance between a point you enter and (3, 14).
Enter the x coordinate of a point.
Enter the y coordinate of a point.
The distance between (3, 14) and (3, 3) is 11.0 units.

	But that number might be ugly.  So let's round it to about 11 units.
